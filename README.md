# Grub Deck Guide
This guide will walk you through the process of installing, and running the grubdeck package on a Debian based system (like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Debian).

## Installation
Since the package is hosted on GitHub, you can use a single command block to download and install it directly.

```
wget https://github.com/abinopoulose/grubdeck/releases/download/deb/grubdeck.deb

sudo apt install ./grubdeck.deb
```


## Running the Application

From the Application Menu: Search for "Grub Deck" in your system's application menu.

From the Terminal: Open a terminal and simply type the command name. You will need to use sudo because the application requires administrative privileges to modify GRUB files.
```
grubdeck
```
